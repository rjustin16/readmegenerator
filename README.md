README generator
## Description
As a programmer it is important to have quality README files when creating repositories on github. Using the power of node inquirer and this README generator we are able to create quality README files from the user's terminal using prompts. First, to be able to use this generator the user must have node on their computer. Then by entering the proper repository in your terminal using the command "node index.js" prompts will come with questions asking the user to describe their project. A demo of how the README generator works is below.
